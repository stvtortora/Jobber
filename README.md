### Create Job Posts and Companies

When users sign up, they are able to add companies and job posts to the database. If requirements change, they can come back later and edit or remove their post.

## Future Developmet

In the future, it would be great to add features that allow job seekers to apply to jobs using resumes that they upload through the platform. Additionally, we can allow employers to search for candidates using the same filter-based approach that was used for jobs and companies.
